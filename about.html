            <h1>About</h1>

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are the class of September 2016 of 23 Code Street: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Anja Vidmar</li>
                <li>Amber Parkin </li>
                <li>Kate Alexander</li>
                <li>Mina Begum</li>
                <li>Rachel Griffiths</li>
                <li>Tasha Nassbaum</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We are the first cohort of 23 Code Street, a coding school for women where for every paying student we teach a disadvantaged woman in India how to code and help her get into work. </p>
            <p>As part of 23 Code Street, we were introduced to women in the slum who’s skills are being exploited and we decided we wanted to create a shop that would create a source of fair revenue and expose their talent to our community.</p>

            <h2>About The Makers</h2>
<p>Our products are all handmade in the biggest slum in Asia- The infamous Dharavi Slum in Mumbai, India. Although structurally illegal, Dharavi is home to over more than a million people. It’s also an incredible centre of creativity- from leathers, jewellery, embroidery, clothing, food and much more, Dharavi is an economic hub with small scale industry thriving in the area.</p>
<p>It’s not just the independent factories though. Individuals create and sell beautiful and intricate products from jewellery, to bags, to home made remedies. </p>
<p>We are working with women who want to create a better, independent life for themselves and their families. We are working closely with a small group of women to create cases for devices full of beauty, personality and story. Each item will come with the proud of it’s origins and maker.</p>
